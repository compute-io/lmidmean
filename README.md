> Computes the [lower interquartile mean](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1268431) (lower midmean) of a numeric array. 


## Installation

``` bash
$ npm install compute-lmidmean
```

For use in the browser, use [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify).


## Usage

To use the module,

``` javascript
var lmidmean = require( 'compute-lmidmean' );
```

#### lmidmean( arr[, sorted] )

Computes the [lower midmean](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1268431) for a numeric `array`. This is computed by discarding all values above the median and calculating the mean of those values falling between the first and third quartiles.

Note: the input array must contain 6 or more elements.

``` javascript
var unsorted = [ 5, 6, 7, 2, 1, 8, 4, 3 ];

var mean = lmidmean( unsorted );
// returns 2.5
```

If the input `array` is already `sorted` in __ascending__ order, set the optional second argument to `true`.

``` javascript
var sorted = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ];

var mean = lmidmean( sorted, true );
// returns 2.5
```

## Examples

``` javascript
var data = new Array( 100 );

for ( var i = 0; i < data.length; i++ ) {
    data[ i ] = Math.round( Math.random()*100 );
}

console.log( lmidmean( data ) );
```

To run the example code from the top-level application directory,

``` bash
$ node ./examples/index.js
```

## Notes

If provided an unsorted input `array`, the function is `O( N log(N) + m )`, where `N` is the input `array` length and `m` is the number of values located between the first and third quartiles of the lower range. If the input `array` is already sorted in __ascending__ order, the function is `O(m)`.

The lower midmean includes the values located between *but not including* the first and third quartiles for the set of values below the median. In the following examples, the values included in the lmidmean are in bold.

*	[1,__2,3__,4,5,6,7,8] —> lmidmean: 2.5

*	[1,2,__3,4__,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12] —> lmidmean: 3.5


## Tests

### Unit

Unit tests use the [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha) test framework with [Chai](http://chaijs.com) assertions. To run the tests, execute the following command in the top-level application directory:

``` bash
$ make test
```

All new feature development should have corresponding unit tests to validate correct functionality.


### Test Coverage

This repository uses [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul) as its code coverage tool. To generate a test coverage report, execute the following command in the top-level application directory:

``` bash
$ make test-cov
```

Istanbul creates a `./reports/coverage` directory. To access an HTML version of the report,

``` bash
$ make view-cov
```
